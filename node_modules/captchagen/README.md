## Usage

```javascript
var captcha = require('captchagen');

var cap = c.create(opt);

/*
Valid options:

height, width, text, font
*/


captcha.text(); // Returns captcha text (randomly generated by default)

captcha.height(); // Returns captcha height (150 by default)

captcha.width(); // Returns captcha width (300 by default)

captcha.generate(); // Draws the image to the canvas

/* GENERATE BEFORE RUNNING THESE */

captcha.uri(cb); // outputs png data-uri. works sync and async (cb is optional)

captcha.buffer(cb); // outputs png buffer. works sync and async (cb is optional)

captcha.buffer(type); // outputs an image stream. type can be either png or jpeg (png is the default)
```

## Middleware

The whole thing is a middleware stack. When you use .create() it uses our default settings which look like this:

```javascript
cap.use(drawBackground);
cap.use(drawLines);
cap.use(drawText);
cap.use(drawLines);
```

To add your own look at the middle folder in lib. You take a canvas in, modify it, and output it again. Simple stuff.
